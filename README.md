👋 Hi, I’m Shivam Mehta

I am a Mechanical Engineer and tinkerer with a passion for robotics, programming, hardware, and mechanical design. I love working on various types of projects, which has provided me with experience in working with Linux, ROS2, Arduino, CAD, and Marlin Firmware.

Recently moved my website content here, so all my past and ongoing projects can be found here. Happy Tinkering:wrench:!
